# Overview

A idea for a project that combines Python and SQL would be to create a web scraping script using Python that collects data from a website and then stores that data in a SQL database. The script could then be scheduled to run regularly to collect updated information.
Once the data is stored in the SQL database, you could use Python to perform analysis on the data and create visualizations using a library such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. Additionally, you could use a web framework like Flask or Django to create a web application that allows users to interact with the data and visualizations stored in the SQL database.
This project would demonstrate your ability to work with both Python and SQL, as well as your understanding of web scraping, data analysis, and web development.

# Scrape Product Prices: Get The Best Price

Shopping can become time consuming, if you’re trying to find the best deal for a specific product. Looking through websites to find the best price on a car, TV, and clothing can take hours; fortunately, this can take you a couple of minutes with our next web scraping project.
1. First, go to your favorite online store and gather data of products like name, price, discount, and links so you can track them down later. Recommended would be the Scrapy library for this project in case you plan to scrape a lot of pages because it’s the fastest web scraping library in Python.
2. For the second part of the project, you have to track the prices extracted, so when the price of a specific product drops considerably, you get a notification.
3. Scrape stock prices -- Scrape bookies odds -- Scrape cryptocurrency prices
